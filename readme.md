## Running the code

If you have [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, all you need to run is:

```bash
uv run manage.py runserver
```

Otherwise, you must make sure you have installed **Python 3.13** and need to setup your virtual environment with:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
pip install .
```

You can then run the Django project with:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
